# Pathfinder Algorithm

**Implementation of shortest path search algorithms for robots**

For the moment, only the _A*_ and _Dijkstra_ algorithms have been implemented, and the _Great Circle_ heuristic function.

**Project not finished yet.**

## How to use it ?
- Store your file (.txt or .csv) that contains the graph in the folder "Graphes".
- Execute **./path**

Then, you can specify the filename, the desired algorithm, the desired heuristic function and the departure and arrival node indexes through a graphic display.

## Your contribution
If you want to report a bug, or a graph configuration that generates an error, or just to improve it, please feel free.

## Future improvements
- Implementation of other pathfinder algorithms : DFS, BFS, Bellman-Ford, ...
- Implementation of other heuristic functions : Manhattan, Euclidean, Octile and Chebyshev
- Comparison of algorithm execution times
- Real-time graphic display
- Self graph construction through a graphic display on a grid
- Adaptation of the program to a robot equipped with an ultrasonic detector
- Switch between the pathfinder algorithms depending on the context of the situation...
