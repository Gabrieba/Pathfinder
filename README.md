# Pathfinder Algorithm

**Implementation of shortest path search algorithms for robots**

For the moment, only the A* and Dijkstra algorithms have been implemented.

## How to use it ?
- Store your file (.txt or .csv) that contains the graph in the folder "Graphes".
- **./path <_filename_> <index_departure> <index_arrival>**

Where '_index_departure_' is the index of departure node, and '_index_arrival_' is the index of arrival node.

## Your contribution
If you want to report a bug, or a graph configuration that generates an error, or just to improve it, please feel free.

## Future improvements
- Implementation of other pathfinder algorithms : DFS, BFS, Bellman-Ford, ...
- Comparison of algorithm execution times
- Real-time graphic display
- Self graph construction through a graphic display on a grid
- Adaptation of the program to a robot equipped with an ultrasonic detector
- Switch between the pathfinder algorithms depending on the context of the situation...
